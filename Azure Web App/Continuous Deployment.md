# Continuous Deployment
Using the free tier of Azure Web App does allow for setup of continuous deployment but not deployment slots
- This setup does allow for getting started with web app development and learning some of the basics

In the Azure Portal, go to the web app and choose Deployment Center
- Follow the prompts to setup GitHub as the source and build provider
- Be sure to have seupt the repository ahead of time, I recommend:
  - GitHub - see this document for initial repository setup
  - Conda - see this for setting up the environment and creating the requirements.txt file
  - Flask - see this for setting up a basic app.py file to test deployment
